# AWS Basics

## What is AWS?
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a cloud platform offering a wide range of computing, storage, database, and other services.
- Operates on a **pay-as-you-go** model – you only pay for what you use.
- Global infrastructure based on **regions** and **availability zones**.

## Key AWS Services
### 1. Compute
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** – virtual machines for running applications.
- **Lambda** – serverless computing, runs code without managing servers.
- **Elastic Beanstalk** – easy application deployment with automatic scaling.

### 2. Storage
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** – object storage, ideal for files, backups.
  - Types: Standard, Glacier (for archiving).
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** – block storage disks for EC2.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)** – shared file system.

### 3. Databases
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)** – managed SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **DynamoDB** – NoSQL, fast and scalable key-value database.
- **Redshift** – data warehouse for analytics.

### 4. Networking
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** – isolated virtual network in the cloud.
- **Route 53** – scalable DNS and domain management.
- **CloudFront** – CDN for fast content delivery.

## Core Concepts
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – user and permission management.
- **Regions** – physical locations where AWS data centers operate.
- **Availability Zones (AZs)** – isolated locations within a region for high availability.

## Getting Started
- Use the **AWS Management Console**, **CLI**, or **SDKs** to interact with services.
- Free tier available for experimenting with many services for 12 months.
