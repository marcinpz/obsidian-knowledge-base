# FluxCD for DevOps

## Overview

FluxCD is a GitOps operator for Kubernetes that automates the deployment of containerized applications and infrastructure configurations from Git repositories. It ensures that the state of Kubernetes clusters matches the configurations defined in Git.

## Key Features

- **Automated GitOps**: Continuous synchronization between Git repositories and Kubernetes clusters.
    
- **Modular Architecture**: Components like Source Controller, Kustomize Controller, Helm Controller, and Notification Controller.
    
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Isolated environments for different teams or applications.
    
- **Progressive Delivery**: Integrates with Flagger for canary releases and blue-green deployments.
    
- **Secure by Design**: Least privilege principles and extensive RBAC support.
    

## Core Components

- **Source Controller**: Manages sources like Git repositories, Helm repositories, and buckets.
    
- **Kustomize Controller**: Applies Kustomize overlays and YAML manifests.
    
- **Helm Controller**: Automates Helm chart releases.
    
- **Notification Controller**: Integrates with external messaging systems (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.).
    

## Typical Use Cases

- Continuous delivery of Kubernetes manifests.
    
- Infrastructure as Code deployments.
    
- Progressive delivery with canary deployments.
    
- Secure, multi-environment cluster management.
    

## Architecture Overview

- Git repository as the single source of truth.
    
- Controllers running inside the Kubernetes cluster.
    
- Reconciliation loops to ensure desired state consistency.
    

## Installation (Quickstart)

```bash
brew install fluxcd/tap/flux
flux install
```

## Basic Workflow

1. **Bootstrap FluxCD** into the cluster.
    
2. **Configure Git Sources** (repositories, Helm repos).
    
3. **Define Kustomization or HelmRelease resources.**
    
4. **FluxCD monitors Git** and reconciles changes into Kubernetes.
    

## Example: Simple GitOps Setup with FluxCD

```bash
flux bootstrap github \
  --owner=<github-username> \
  --repository=<repository-name> \
  --branch=main \
  --path=./clusters/my-cluster
```

## Best Practices

- Use separate repositories for infrastructure and application configs.
    
- Implement Git branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow, trunk-based development).
    
- Secure Git repositories and apply code reviews.
    
- Monitor FluxCD components and cluster health.
    
- Use Flagger for advanced deployment strategies.
    

## Advantages Compared to ArgoCD

- Native Kubernetes manifests and CRDs.
    
- CLI-centric with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket integrations.
    
- Lightweight and modular.
    
- Strong multi-tenant capabilities.
