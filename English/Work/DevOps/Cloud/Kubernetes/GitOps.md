# GitOps for DevOps

## Overview

GitOps is a modern operational framework that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application deployments. It automates the deployment, monitoring, and management of cloud-native applications by leveraging Git workflows.

## Key Principles

- **Declarative Descriptions**: System state is described declaratively (e.g., YAML, Helm charts).
    
- **Versioned and Immutable**: All changes are version-controlled in Git.
    
- **Automatic Application**: A GitOps agent automatically applies changes to the infrastructure.
    
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: System constantly checks if live state matches the desired state in Git.
    

## Benefits for DevOps

- **Improved Reliability**: Rollbacks are as simple as reverting a Git commit.
    
- **Enhanced Security**: Git access control ensures secure and auditable changes.
    
- **Developer Experience**: Developers manage infrastructure with familiar Git workflows.
    
- **Scalability**: Easily manage large fleets of clusters and environments.
    
- **Auditability**: Full change history available through Git logs.
    

## Core Components

- **Git Repository**: Central place for declarative configuration.
    
- **Continuous Delivery (CD) Tools**: Agents like ArgoCD, FluxCD pull the desired state from Git.
    
- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Target environments for deployment.
    
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Systems like Prometheus, Grafana to observe deployments.
    

## Basic GitOps Workflow

1. **Change in Git**: Developer pushes a code or configuration change.
    
2. **Automatic Detection**: GitOps tool detects the change.
    
3. **Sync Process**: The tool applies changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
    
4. **Validation and Monitoring**: The live system is monitored to ensure consistency.
    

## Typical Tools

- **ArgoCD**: Declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool.
    
- **FluxCD**: GitOps operator for Kubernetes.
    
- **Kustomize**: Template-free YAML customization tool.
    
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package manager (often integrated into GitOps workflows).
    

## Best Practices

- Separate configuration repositories from application source code.
    
- Implement branch protection and code review workflows.
    
- Use clear commit messages for traceability.
    
- Automate security scanning and validation of configurations.
    
- Monitor synchronization status and cluster health continuously.
    

## Example Folder Structure

```plaintext
├── apps
│   ├── production
│   └── staging
├── infrastructure
│   ├── clusters
│   └── networking
└── README.md
```

## Common Challenges

- Handling secrets (solution: sealed secrets, external secret managers).
    
- Managing drift between desired and live states.
    
- Dealing with non-declarative components.
    
- Scaling GitOps for multiple teams and clusters.
