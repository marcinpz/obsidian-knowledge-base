### 🔹 **SLI – Service Level Indicator**

- **What it is**: A **measurable metric** that indicates how a service is performing.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Availability (e.g., 99.95% uptime over the last 30 days)
        
    - Request latency (e.g., 95% of responses < 200 ms)
        
    - Error rate (e.g., <0.1% of failed HTTP requests)
        
- **Purpose**: To **quantify** service performance.

### 🔸 **SLO – Service Level Objective**

- **What it is**: A **target value** or range for a specific SLI that you aim to meet.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - "Our API should have 99.9% availability each month"
        
    - "95% of requests should complete within 300 ms"
        
- **Purpose**: To **set expectations** internally for engineering teams.

### 📝 **SLA – Service Level Agreement**

- **What it is**: A **formal contract** between a service provider and a customer, based on SLOs.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - "If monthly availability drops below 99.5%, the customer gets a 10% service credit"
        
- **Purpose**: To define **business obligations** and consequences if objectives are not met.

### 📊 **KPI – Key Performance Indicator**

- **What it is**: A **business-oriented metric** used to evaluate success in meeting strategic goals.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Customer churn rate
        
    - Revenue growth
        
    - Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
        
- **Purpose**: To measure **overall business performance**, not just technical reliability.
