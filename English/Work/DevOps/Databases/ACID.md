## 🧪 ACID – Reliable Transactions in Databases (for DevOps)

**ACID** defines four key properties of a transaction in relational databases. These ensure data **integrity**, especially important for **DevOps** when dealing with **microservices, CI/CD, DB migrations**, and **resilience**.

---

### 🔹 A – Atomicity

**All or nothing**: A transaction is a single unit. If one part fails, the entire transaction rolls back.  
🛠 _Example: A failed schema migration rolls back all changes – no partial updates._

---

### 🔹 C – Consistency

**Valid state transitions only**: The database moves from one valid state to another.  
🛠 _Example: Constraints and foreign keys ensure data rules aren’t violated during deployments._

---

### 🔹 I – Isolation

**Concurrent transactions don’t interfere**: Transactions run as if they're the only ones in the system.  
🛠 _Example: Avoids dirty reads during simultaneous API calls writing to the same record._

---

### 🔹 D – Durability

**Once committed, it stays**: Changes survive crashes or power loss.  
🛠 _Example: Write-Ahead Logs (WAL), replication, and backup strategies in production._

## 💡 ACID in DevOps Context

- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensure atomic DB migrations – test rollback paths.
    
- 🔍 **Observability**: Monitor for data consistency across services.
    
- ⚙️ **High Availability**: ACID ensures resilience during failovers.
    
- 🧪 **Chaos Testing**: Verify durability under simulated crashes.
