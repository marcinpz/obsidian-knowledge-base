## Overview

Daily operations in DevOps aim to ensure system reliability, fast recovery from issues, smooth deployments, and efficient collaboration between development and operations teams.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Monitoring & Alerting**
- **Incident Response**
- **Deployments & Rollbacks**
- **Backup & Restore Management**
- **System Maintenance & Updates**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Management**
- **Security & Compliance Monitoring**
- **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

## Daily Checklist

- Review system dashboards (Grafana, Datadog, Prometheus).
- Check alerting systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, email alerts).
- Monitor CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
- Validate backup completion and status.
- Review open incidents and issues.
- Plan and execute minor deployments if required.
- Apply critical patches to systems or clusters.
- Validate security reports (vulnerability scans, access reviews).
- Perform drift detection in IaC systems (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi, GitOps tools).

## Key Tools

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, NewRelic
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager, PagerDuty, OpsGenie
- **CI/CD**: ArgoCD, FluxCD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **IaC**: Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible
- **Container Management**: Kubernetes, Docker, Rancher
- **Logging**: Loki, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Backup**: Velero (Kubernetes), custom scripts
- **Security**: Aqua Security, Trivy, Open Policy Agent (OPA)

## Incident Management

- Triage alerts promptly.
- Communicate status to relevant stakeholders.
- Follow runbooks for known issues.
- Document new incidents and resolutions.

## Deployment Strategies

- **Canary Deployments**
- **Blue/Green Deployments**
- **Rolling Updates**
- **Feature Flags**

## Communication Tools

- Slack, Microsoft Teams (incident channels)
- Jira, ServiceNow (ticketing and change management)

## Best Practices

- Automate repetitive tasks as much as possible.
- Practice blameless postmortems.
- Keep runbooks up-to-date.
- Regularly review system performance and bottlenecks.
- Prioritize security and compliance checks.
- Maintain a "change calendar" for visibility into planned changes.

## Continuous Improvement

- Conduct regular retrospectives on incidents and outages.
- Implement SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and SLIs (Service Level Indicators).
- Invest in training and skill development.
