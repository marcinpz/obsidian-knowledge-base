The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking systems communicate. It consists of **7 layers**, from physical hardware transmission up to user-level interactions.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the **7 OSI layers**, from bottom to top:

1. **Physical Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium
        
    - _Examples:_ Cables, switches, voltage levels
        
2. **Data Link Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Ensures reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes
        
    - _Examples:_ MAC addresses, Ethernet, switches
        
3. **Network Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Determines how data is sent to the receiving device via routing
        
    - _Examples:_ IP addresses, routers
        
4. **Transport Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Provides reliable data transfer, error recovery, and flow control
        
    - _Examples:_ TCP, UDP
        
5. **Session Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Manages sessions or connections between applications
        
    - _Examples:_ APIs, NetBIOS
        
6. **Presentation Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Translates, encrypts, and compresses data
        
    - _Examples:_ SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII
        
7. **Application Layer**
    
    - _Function:_ Provides services directly to the user
        
    - _Examples:_ HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
